## Overview
Our group has decided to investigate over 30 offensive and defensive metrics of all 32 NFL teams over the past 10 years to see if there is
a winning formula for surviving the regular season, playoffs, and ultimately winning the big game. All of the offensive/defensive metrics 
will be taken from Pro Football Reference (www.pro-football-reference.com) and exported to a CSV. All final team rankings over the past 
10 years will be taken from ESPN (www.espn.com) and using team names and year as a primary key will join the two datasets. Models will be 
developed on the premise of predicting the Super Bowl winner and all of the playoff results for every team based off of their regular 
season statistics. Our initial hypothesis would be that the team with the best overall statistics would be the Super Bowl favorite.
