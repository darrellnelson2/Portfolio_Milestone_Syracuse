# Overview

Background:
Last year, the U.S. was ranked 18th on the happiness scale. Taking a look at the trend, this number seems to be falling each year in the
U.S. even as we are getting richer as a country. Pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal, so we are interested in analyzing the
world happiness data to determine which key factors promote overall happiness and life satisfaction.

Situation:
People are constantly looking for ways to be happier and more satisfied with life. We are seeing a “mindfulness” movement being employed 
in workforces everywhere and are encouraged to take a break or go on a vacation to feel refreshed and rejuvenated to return to work. We 
believe there are specific customer segments, who would be interested in traveling on a vacation to experience what it’s like to live in
the happiest country in the world. 

Proposal:
We are a Marketing Consultant Firm based in NY and have been contracted to support an analysis on world happiness trends for the National
Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO). Our data analysis will seek to answer the following questions: What significant factors contribute to
the world happiness ranking? Which top 5 countries are considered to be the happiest in the world from 2015-2017?
