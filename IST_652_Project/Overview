# Overview of Project

The dataset used is a collection of Twitter data compiled by gaining access to the Twitter API through the python program tweepy. 
The dataset imported was a collection of 3,041 tweets that were released by the teams in the Pacific 12 conference (Pac-12).
Each tweet was imported and listed as a json structure. The data was manipulated with numpy and pandas dataframes. 
There was no preprocessing required. The semi-structured data came with the appropriate labels and datatypes to facilitate the analysis.

Twitter accounts of all football teams selected were scraped for the number of tweets and how many retweets and likes each tweet received.
The schools were then ranked based on the amount of buzz they generated for their teams during the 2018 offseason (02/01/2018 – 07/24/2018).
The school rankings were then compared to their pre-season and recruiting rankings. The pre-season rankings were taken from the Pac-12 
media day on 07/25/2018. Media members are asked to vote for where they believe each team will place, and each vote has a number assigned
to it with more points assigned to teams that will have the most success. Each team’s points are then compiled into a list and ranked from 
highest to lowest. The recruiting rankings were taken from 247Sports.com for the 2018 Pac-12 year. Each recruit that committed to a team is
assigned an overall rating, then the 247Sports analytics team uses a Gaussian distribution to rank all recruits on that team. The teams 
are then ranked in descending order of points.

## Data Questions
•	Does social media affect how many top football recruits a school gets? 
    o	Group the counts of the tweets, likes, and retweets each school’s official twitter account generated/received during the 
    offseason into a pandas dataframe. Create a column for retweets per tweet, how many people decided the content was so good 
    that they should share it on their story. Create a column for number of likes per tweet, how many people saw and “liked” the post. 
    The data is then sorted in descending order for each attribute. Team positions/rankings by Twitter are then compared to the recruiting
    rankings given by 247Sports.com. The overall distance between the predicted rankings and the real rankings for each team are calculated
    and the absolute value is taken. The feature that produced the lowest distance value is the feature with the fewest deviations from 
    the true ranking.  

•	Is there a correlation between twitter activity in the offseason and pre-season rankings?
    o	Preseason polls are released at the end of July or August. The same dataframe and methodology that was used above was used here 
    with a replacement of the recruiting rankings with the Pac-12 media day pre-season rankings.
    
## Output
Outputs will be sorted dataframes that contain the team names, number of tweets, likes, retweets per tweet, and likes per tweet. Two other
dataframes: 1) Distance Metric vs Pre-Season Rankings and 2) Distance Metric vs Recruiting Rankings were also outputted. Bar graphs for
each attribute ranked in descending order are outputted to the console. A print statement stating the feature that best approximates the 
top 3 finishers and the overall finishers in the conference with the distance metric for each are outputted to the console.

All dataframes were exported to CSV or Excel files that are readable by Excel.
